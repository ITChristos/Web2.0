    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h3>ITChristos</h3>

    <p>
        Thank you for visiting my webpage dedicated to network certification studies. Here I hope that we can build a community dedicated to helping each-other learn networking concepts, share resources, build relationships, and become all-around better people.
        This website was created with the advancement of like-minded professionals in consideration. First, let me introduce myself:
    </p>

    <p>
        My name is Christos and I am currently studying for my CCNA. I live in Yelm, WA and am currently working for the United States Army. I serve as a Sniper Section Leader in a Reconnaissance Squadron at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. I have been in the military
        for almost 10 years now, but it has come time for me to get out and rejoin the rest of the civilian world. Everything that I do is for my family and two sons, Nolan and Cooper, including gaining certifications and networking. The IT sector is
        a lucrative and growing market that is going to be expanding for a very long time. Because of that, I know that getting a job in IT will be the best move to take care of my family. However, studying and taking the many required IT certifications
        can be a very expensive process and for the majority of people seeking to gain an entry-level position, we just don't have the capital to spend on it.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have noticed that there is a lack of community groups that are completely free. Most companies want you to spend your hard-earned money to even get a foot in the door. Even then, they limit the useful resources to premier accounts, or add-ons. I would
        like to contribute my time and effort into making a completely free to use community that is there to help people gain the certifications that will change their life, all while remaining free to use.
    </p>
