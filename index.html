    <h2>CCNA</h2>
    <h4>This section focuses on the <span class="boldtext italictext">CCNA</span> 200-301 exam</h4>

    <p>
        The Cisco Certified Network Associate is the holy grail of entry-level certifications that somebody wanting to get into IT as a Network Administrator should want to achieve. It is only preceded by Network + and Security + in scope. Some employers consider
        a <span class="boldtext">CCNA</span> holder to be well qualified even without an accompanying Computer Science degree. The <span class="boldtext">CCNA</span> has long been the gold standard when it comes to entry-level certifications.
        Because of this, I find it very valuable to have and why I am pursuing a <span class="boldtext">CCNA</span> before my other certifications.
    </p>

    <p>Let's first give a brief overview of the exam objectives and percentage of coverage in the new exam which was released earlier this year. The <span class="boldtext">CCNA</span> covers your knowledge and skill on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Network Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Network Access</li>
        <li>IP Connectivity</li>
        <li>IP Services</li>
        <li>Security Fundamentals</li>
        <li>Automation and Programmability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network+</h2>
    <h4>This section focuses on the <span class="boldtext italictext">COMPTIA Network+ </span>N10-007 Exam</h4>

    <p>
        Network+ is a network certification run by CompTIA. It is a vendor-neutral certification that focuses on the basics of troubleshooting, configuring, and managing networks. It covers configuration, management, and troubleshooting of common wired and wireless
        network devices. It also covers security concepts, though that is more of a broad subject as the Security + exam more closely examines network security. CompTIA Network + is geared toward entry-level network and system engineers. Topics of the
        Network+ exam include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Critical security concepts to helping networking professionals work with security practitioners</li>
        <li>Key cloud computing best practices and typical service models</li>
        <li>Coverage of newer hardware and virtualization techniques</li>
        <li>Concepts to give individuals the combination of skills to keep the network resilient</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security +</h2>
    <h4>This section focuses on the <span class="boldtext italictext">COMPTIA Security+</span> SYO-501 Exam</h4>

    <p>
        According to the CompTIA website: "Security+ is the first security certification IT professionals should earn." They say that because by achieving the certification, you show that you have a base knowledge of skills and knowledge to perform a cybersecurity
        role. Known as Sec+ for short, the exam will prepare you to have a more wide base of knowledge than somebody coming into the IT sector with no knowledge. The whole point of an IT certification is to demonstrate that you have what it takes to perform
        a certain role. This is why employers pay such a high value to certifications. By seeing somebody with certifications they know that not only are they capable of learning the subject matter, but they will not have to bear the costs of training
        an employee from the ground up. In my opinion, gaining baseline certifications like these should not cost anyone more than the exam itself. There is plenty of material available to teach somebody what it takes to be a Sec+ for free. Somebody just
        needs to aggregate the information into one location like I plan to do on this website.
    </p>

    <p>Sec+ focuses on the following skills as viewed on the CompTIA website:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Detect various types of compromise and understand penetration testing and vulnerability scanning concepts
        </li>
        <li>Install, configure, and deploy network architecture concepts and systems design</li>
        <li>Install and configure identity and access services and management controls</li>
        <li>Implement and summarize risk management best practices and the business impact</li>
        <li>Install and configure wireless security settings and implement PKI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Linux+</h2>
    <h4>This section focuses on the <span class="boldtext italictext">COMPTIA Linux+</span> XKO-004 Exam</h4>

    <p>
        Now on to my final certification I will be focusing on. This one is not specifically a networking certification, but I feel like it is something every Network Engineer should pursue in light of the future of networking. More and more, network administration
        is relying on automation to streamline management and leave the mundane repetitive tasks to the computer. The Linux+ exam is yet again another CompTIA certification. It is meant to validate the skills of system administrators supporting Linux
        system. Since Linux distributions are the most widely used Operating Systems around the world and is emerging in many new technologies (like IoT, servers, etc.) it is crucial that future IT professionals start to develop a firm grasp on Linux
        OS. CompTIA Linux+ covers common tasks in major distributions of Linux (there are a plethora) specifically focusing on:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Linux Command Line</li>
        <li>Basic maintenance, installing, and configuring workstations</li>
        <li>Networking and Firewalls</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Kernel Modules</li>
        <li>Storage and Virtualization</li>
        <li>Git and automation</li>
        <li>Server side and command line</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting and SELinux</li>
    </ul>
